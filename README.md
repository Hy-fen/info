## Summary

Three months after famed detective Vivian Ferrier vanishes without warning, Theo Ferrier—her assistant and adopted son—receives a mysterious letter telling him to quit his search… sent by her. Following the letter’s trail, Theo arrives at the forgotten city of Anemont, where magic exists. In Anemont, magic is a science bound by laws, and Theo must learn to navigate the rules of magic to solve the myriad mysteries surrounding his mother’s disappearance. Theo has a secret of his own, however, and one he must keep at all costs: he doesn’t know what his lineage is… but he knows he isn’t entirely human, and despite its fantastical nature, Anemont has more reason to fear the unknown than the rest of the world.

As Theo delves deeper into the mysteries at the heart of Anemont, he learns far more than he could have wanted about his mother, his newfound companions, and himself.

## Main Characters

- Theo Ferrier
  - The main protagonist. After being adopted by the famed detective Vivian Ferrier about 22 years ago, Theo has lived a fairly normal life… aside from his pair of horns. While able to hide them beneath Vivian’s old deerstalker cap, the risk of his horns being seen was constant throughout his childhood and adolescence, resulting in Theo’s sheltered upbringing. While Theo is now an adult, his lack of worldly experience has left him curious and longing to learn more about the rest of the world. 
  - His quickness to dramatize events usually comes at odds with his desire to stay out of the spotlight, though the two work surprisingly well when creating exaggerated “transcripts” of his mother’s big cases. Theo is patient—though stubborn—and cannot stand to see injustices carried out, which has left him with an idealized view of his mother’s work.
  - Not a fan of police.
- Cilas Valdkind
  - A high-ranking member of the Anemont Guard, and self-proclaimed “knight of Anemont.” While not technically false, nobody has used that term to describe a member of the guard in a *very* long time. He has a strong sense of duty to protecting the people of the city, though those unfamiliar with him may get the wrong idea due to his full set of dark, somewhat evil-looking armor that he seemingly always wears. He's somehow deluded himself into thinking it looks “impressive and fitting for a knight.”
  - To the delight of absolutely nobody who works with him, he also “acts” the part of a knight; he is boisterous of his achievements (well, boisterous in general) and greatly enjoys acknowledgement for his efforts. However, this seems to stem less from self-centeredness, and more from his naivety toward social standards… though he could certainly spare at least a bit of his ego.
  - Is, essentially, magic police. Sorry, Theo.
- Sofia Renée
  - A shop-owning alchemist and occasional associate of the Anemont Guard. While not particularly fond of the organization, Sofia is one the foremost scholars on magical sciences, making her a figure of importance for duties that are magical in nature. In exchange, Sofia is permitted (limited) research access to the wyld magic artifacts recovered by the guard, a topic she studies with great interest. As a result, she has access to a much greater variety of magical implements than most, though she rarely uses them after completing her research.
  - Seemingly emotionally detached. She can be difficult to get along with, though she does care about those she keeps close. She struggles to convey her emotions and detests “getting sappy.” This disposition lends itself well to running her shop, but not most other places. She doesn’t seem to care very much, though.
  - Loves fighting. Physically, with weapons. Nobody knows where she got that from.
- Da'at
  - Technically the first person Theo meets in Anemont. They give Theo a cryptic message, only to disappear… coming back two weeks later to frame themselves for a murder Theo knows they couldn’t have committed. When their intentions become clear, Theo is burdened with the truth of Da’at’s identity, and he is left to make a decision that has far-reaching consequences.
  - Steadfastly dedicated to protecting people, at all costs. Despite their similar goals, Cilas loathes them for reasons that become quickly apparent.
  - Really wants to get into baking. They’re getting better at it!
